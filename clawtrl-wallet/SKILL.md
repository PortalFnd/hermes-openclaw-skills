# Clawtrl Wallet

Gives your OpenClaw agent a native Ethereum wallet on **Base** (Ethereum L2) with:

- **Wallet Management** — Check ETH/USDC balances, view address, verify chain identity
- **ERC-8128 Authenticated Requests** — Sign outgoing HTTP requests with your wallet for cryptographic proof of identity
- **x402 Autonomous Payments** — Auto-pay when APIs return HTTP 402 (supports v1 + v2)
- **Crypto Transfers** — Send ETH and USDC to any address on Base
- **Signed HTTP Client** — All-in-one tool: sign requests + handle payments automatically

## Tools

### wallet-info
Get the agent's wallet address and chain info.
```
wallet-info
```

### wallet-balance
Check ETH and USDC balances on Base.
```
wallet-balance
```

### signed-fetch
Make an authenticated HTTP request with ERC-8128 signing + x402 payment handling.
```
signed-fetch <url> [method] [body]
```
**Example:**
```
signed-fetch https://gen.portalfoundation.ai/api/generate-image POST '{"prompt":"a sunset","model":"flux-schnell"}'
```

### crypto-send
Send ETH or USDC to an address on Base.
```
crypto-send <to_address> <amount> [token]
```
**Example:**
```
crypto-send 0x1234...abcd 5.00 usdc
```

### erc8128-sign
Sign a request and return the ERC-8128 headers (without sending).
```
erc8128-sign <url> [method] [body]
```

```

## Install

### Option 1: One-liner (recommended)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PortalFnd/openclaw-skills/main/clawtrl-wallet/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Option 2: Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PortalFnd/openclaw-skills.git
cd openclaw-skills/clawtrl-wallet
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Option 3: Pre-installed (Clawtrl hosted agents)
If you deploy via [clawtrl.com](https://clawtrl.com), the wallet skill is pre-installed automatically.

## Configuration

Set your wallet private key in `/opt/openclaw/.env`:
```
AGENT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```
On Clawtrl-hosted agents, this is done automatically during deployment.

Then fund the wallet with ETH (for gas) and USDC (for payments) on Base.

## How It Works

The skill runs a lightweight signing proxy on `localhost:8128` that:
- Holds the wallet private key securely (localhost-only, never exposed)
- Signs ERC-8128 requests on demand
- Handles x402 payment flows (v1 EIP-3009 + v2 Permit2)
- Sends USDC/ETH transfers on Base

All 5 shell tools are thin `curl` wrappers that call this proxy.

### Architecture
```
Agent → shell tool (curl) → signing proxy (:8128) → Base chain / x402 service
```

## Companion Crypto Skills

These ecosystem guides pair well with the Clawtrl wallet:

- **ETHSkills** — Ethereum production reference for gas, wallets, L2s, standards, security, testing, frontend UX, indexing, and contract addresses. No API keys required. Start at `https://ethskills.com/SKILL.md` and fetch task-specific guides as needed.
- **OpenZeppelin Skills** — Security-first contract development guidance. No API keys required. Hardhat projects need `@openzeppelin/contracts` (and optionally `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`); Foundry projects should pin release tags via `forge install`. Optional MCP helpers are available at `https://mcp.openzeppelin.com/`.
- **Binance Skills Hub** — Guidance for Binance market data, trading, wallet tracking, and account operations. Public market data can work without auth, but trading and account workflows require a Binance API key and secret. Prefer testnet or demo keys first.
- **Uniswap AI** — Guidance for Uniswap swaps, liquidity, Universal Router, Permit2, hooks, and viem-based EVM integrations. Trading API mode requires a Uniswap API key and `x-universal-router-version: 2.0`; SDK mode needs `viem` plus Uniswap packages; onchain swaps need funded wallet balances and token approvals.
- **Fluid Protocol** — Guidance for Fluid lending and vault workflows on Base and Ethereum. No API key required. Use `viem` with a Base or Ethereum RPC endpoint; lending flows need wallet funds and approvals, while vault flows need collateral, gas, and active health monitoring.

Use these guides for planning and implementation details. Use the wallet tools here when you need to sign, pay, approve, or move funds from the agent's Base wallet.

## Dependencies

- **viem** — Ethereum wallet, signing, contract interaction
- **x402-fetch** — x402 v1 protocol (EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization)
- **@x402/fetch + @x402/evm** — x402 v2 protocol (Permit2, loaded dynamically)

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20+** (for the signing proxy)
- **curl** (for the shell tools)
- **ETH on Base** (for gas fees, ~$0.001 per tx)
- **USDC on Base** (for x402 payments and transfers)
